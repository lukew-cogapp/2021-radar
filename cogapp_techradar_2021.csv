AWS Fargate,trial,platforms,FALSE,"AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers.

AWS Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them.",
AWS Lambda Layers,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers. A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. With layers, you can use libraries in your function without needing to include them in your deployment package. Layers let you keep your deployment package small, which makes development easier. You can avoid errors that can occur when you install and package dependencies with your function code. For Node.js, Python, and Ruby functions, you can develop your function code in the Lambda console as long as you keep your deployment package under 3 MB.",
AWS EFS Infrequent Access,assess,platforms,FALSE,"Amazon EFS Infrequent Access (EFS IA) is a new storage class for Amazon EFS that is cost-optimized for files that are accessed less frequently. Amazon EFS provides a simple, scalable, elastic file system for Linux-based workloads for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. Customers can now use EFS IA to more cost-effectively store larger amounts of data in their file systems, expanding their ability to use Amazon EFS to an even wider set of applications. EFS IA reduces storage costs for files not accessed every day, with savings up to 85% compared to the EFS Standard storage class. ",
